# AMPERe
Automated Melt Pool Edge Renderer

AMPERe is a proof-of-concept tool for detecting the dimensions of a melt pool from x-ray images. It is intended for later implementation with OpenMSI for automated data processing.

# TO-DO
* ~~Acquire more sample data~~
* ~~Tune contour calculation and rendering~~
* Optimize/refactor for streaming integration
* ~~Fix extra window bug when launching GUI~~ (deprecated)
* ~~Fix automatic slider position detection~~
* Perform scale tests and optimize if appropriate
* ~~Improve threading safety~~ (deprecated)
